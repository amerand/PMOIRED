Data tend to be spectrally correlated, as they are taken all at the same time, from the same telescopes etc. `oi.bootstrapFit` takes at least one parameter `Nfits` the number of fits to perform.

In practice, uncertainties by bootstrapping should be prefered, even though it can be time consuming to estimate them. \n",

    "In the previous fit, we get a warning because the wavelength of the line may not be converging properly. `oi.showFit` shows the evolution of the parameters during the fit: both `line_brg_wl0` for `A` and `B` show little spikes in $\\chi^2$, showing that the parameters varies too much. In essence, the gradient descent has trouble fitting a parameter which uncertainty is much smaller that its value (we have typically err/value$\\sim$5e-6 for `A,line_brg_wl0`).\n",

    "To mitigate this, we can re-parametrise the central wavelengths as Doppler shift to the rest wavelength of Brackett $\\gamma$. This has also the advantage to give us the radial velocity of each star, which are expected to vary epoch to epoch due to the orbital motion. The fit is much faster to converge, as err/value$\\sim$1.7e-2 for `vA`."
